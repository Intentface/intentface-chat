// Composer.Popover — the floating alternative to a Composer.Panel for the
// command list. Where a Panel renders in-flow (growing the composer), Popover
// lifts the same CommandList children into a portal above the field, so it
// overlays instead of pushing layout. Like Panel, it's content-driven: the
// consumer gates its children on `commands.active`, so an empty popover (all
// gated out) stays closed. Positioned against the active command badge with
// collision handling (flip / shift / size) via useAnchorPositioning, portaled to
// the body. Exposes data-open/data-closed for the open/close animation plus
// data-side/data-align (from the positioner) so the transition origin can follow
// a flip, and a --anchor-available-height var so the list caps height + scrolls.
